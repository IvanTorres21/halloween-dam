                <h2>Jack o'lantern Story</h2>
                <p id="pMid">
                    Stingy Jack was a miserable, old drunk who took pleasure in playing tricks on just about everyone:
                    family,friends, his mother and even the Devil himself. One day, he tricked the Devil into climbing
                    up an
                    apple tree.
                </p>
                <p id="pMid">
                    After the Devil climbed up the tree, Stingy Jack hurriedly placed crosses around the trunk of the
                    tree.
                    Unable to touch a cross, the Devil was stuck in the tree. Stingy Jack made the Devil promise him not
                    to
                    take his soul when he died. Once the devil promised not to take his soul, Stingy Jack removed the
                    crosses, and the Devil climbed down out of the apple tree.
                </p>
                <p id="pMid">
                    Many years later, Jack died, he went to the pearly gates of Heaven and was told by Saint Peter that
                    he
                    was mean and cruel, and had led a miserable, worthless life on earth. Stingy Jack was not allowed to
                    enter heaven. He then went down to Hell and the Devil. The Devil kept his promise and would not
                    allow
                    him to enter Hell. Now Jack was scared.
                </p>
                <p id="pMid">
                    He had nowhere to go, but to wander about forever in the dark Netherworld between heaven and hell.
                    He
                    asked the Devil how he could leave, as there was no light. The Devil tossed him an ember from the
                    flames
                    of Hell, to help Stingy Jack light his way. Jack had a Turnip with him. It was one of his favorite
                    foods, and he always carried one with him.
                </p>
                <p id="pMid">
                    Jack hollowed out the Turnip, and placed the ember the Devil had given him, inside the turnip. From
                    that
                    day onward, Stingy Jack roamed the earth without a resting place, lighting his way as he went with
                    his
                    "Jack O'Lantern".
                </p>
                <p id="pMid">
                    On all Hallow's eve, the Irish hollowed out Turnips, rutabagas, gourds, potatoes and beets. They
                    placed
                    a light in them to ward off evil spirits and keep Stingy Jack away. These were the original Jack
                    O'Lanterns. In the 1800's a couple of waves of Irish immigrants came to America. The Irish
                    immigrants
                    quickly discovered that Pumpkins were bigger and easier to carve out. So they used pumpkins for Jack
                    O'Lanterns.
